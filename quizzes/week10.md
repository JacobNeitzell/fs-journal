```
**3.** What is the method that returns an instance of a class, yet it has no return type?

void function
```
## Example 1
```c#
abstract class Car
{
  ...
  public virtual string Start()
  {
    return "Vroooom";

**6.** In the example what is `string` an indication of?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the type of data that would be displayed 
```
**7.** In the example what is `abstract` preventing?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it being used in any other methods 
```
**8.** In the example what is the purpose of `virtual`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
ensures that the method has the correct function calling to the object

```
**9.** Name four access modifiers:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
public, private, protected and standard 

```
**10.** If you set a class or method to private, what can access it?
