## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
unit tests, snapshot tests, and end-to-end tests. the process of running tests against the smallest parts of an application (units). Normally the units you test are functions, snapshot test tests are similar to Spot the Difference. A snapshot test takes a picture of your running application and compares it against previously saved pictures. If the pictures are different, the test fails. This test method is a useful way to make sure an application continues to render correctly after code changes. end to end test end-to-end tests are great for checking an app, but they can be slow and flaky. The best way to avoid flaky tests is to not write them, so the frontend testing pyramid contains only a few end-to-end tests.
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
end to end test since it is the best way to avoid flaky tests
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
unit tesst since it is the smallest part
